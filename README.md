In this repository I added some comments to my previous Midterm Requirement in our subject Programming 2
This code follows important Java programming best practices such as effective error handling, clear variable naming, and well-organized structure. 
The calculateNaturalLog method computes the natural logarithm of a given number using the BigDecimal class and checks for valid input, 
throwing an Illegal ArgumentException if the input is zero or negative. 
The main method includes a try-catch block to handle any exceptions nicely, and comments throughout the code explain the logic and purpose of each part, making the code easier to read and maintain.
